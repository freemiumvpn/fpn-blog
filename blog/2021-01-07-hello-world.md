This blog has been boostraped with [docosaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation).
The idea is to document the process of building Freemiumpn from scratch.
These initial posts wont be curated (at least for now) and are but snapshots of
the current progress. ðŸš€

<!--truncate-->

[Freemiumpn](https://freemiumpn.com) is an VPN initiative, that aims to provide
near "free" privacy online. I say near free since nothing is really free,
decisions will be made (the baseline being time vs money), for both the product and the user.

If you are interested in seeing how these technologies interact to build this
initiative, you can inspect the [codebase](http://github.com/freemiumvpn/).
Alternatively, drop me a message and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.

I will leave you with a few premises that will rule this ongoing process.

- `Done is better than perfect` -- Anonymous Genius
- `Make it work, make it right, make it fast` -- Kent Beck
