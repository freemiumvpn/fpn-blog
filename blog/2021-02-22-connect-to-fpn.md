MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. The goal is to **publish** a lean version of the product in order to establish a conversation with you, the customer, **as early as possible**.

[Freemiumpn](https://freemiumpn.com)'s MVP is no exception. It is only by exposing our ideas that we can assess their desirability and gain knowledge of what might be expected in the near future. Communication is key, we are actively listening and adapting based on your feedback 🔥
